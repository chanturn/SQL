In this example, I am querying a multi-table database to gain insights on customers and order data

#1 How many orders where placed in January? Filter out blank order ID 
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "";

#2 How many iPhone were ordered in January?
SELECT COUNT(Product),Product
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "";

#3 What are the order numbers from customers that ordered in Feb?
SELECT customers.acctnum, customers.order_id
FROM BIT_DB0.customers 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.FebSales
ON customers.order_id= FebSales.orderID;

#4 What is the cheapest item and its price that was sold in Jan?
SELECT product, price
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
ORDER BY price;

#5 What is the Jan sales revenue?
SELECT SUM(Price*quantity) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "";

#6 What are the products, quantity and revenue that were shipped to 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101?
SELECT product, quantity, SUM(Price*quantity) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101";

#7How many customers ordered more than 2 products in Feb and what was the avg those customers spent?

SELECT
count(distinct customers.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.customers 
ON FEB.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#8 What products were sold to customers in Los Angeles and how many of each were sold?

SELECT product,SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY Product;
