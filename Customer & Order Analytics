In this example, I am querying a multi-table database to gain insights on customers and order data

#1 How many orders where placed in January? Filter out blank order ID 
SELECT COUNT(Product)
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "";

#2 How many iPhone were ordered in January?
SELECT COUNT(Product),Product
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "";

#3 What are the order numbers from customers that ordered in Feb?
SELECT customers.acctnum, customers.order_id
FROM BIT_DB0.customers 
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.FebSales
ON customers.order_id= FebSales.orderID;

#4 What is the cheapest item and its price that was sold in Jan?
SELECT product, price
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
ORDER BY price;

#5 What is the Jan sales revenue?
SELECT SUM(Price*quantity) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
WHERE length(orderID)=6
AND orderID <> "";

#6 What are the products, quantity and revenue that were shipped to 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101?
SELECT product, quantity, SUM(Price*quantity) Revenue
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
WHERE location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101";

#7How many customers ordered more than 2 products in Feb and what was the avg those customers spent?

SELECT
count(distinct customers.acctnum), 
avg(quantity*price)
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales Feb
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.customers 
ON FEB.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE Feb.Quantity>2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'


#8 What products were sold to customers in Los Angeles and how many of each were sold?

SELECT product,SUM(quantity)
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
WHERE location LIKE "%Los Angeles%"
GROUP BY Product;


#9 Which locations in New York received at least 3 orders in January, and how many orders did they each receive? 

SELECT COUNT(orderID) Order_Count, location
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
WHERE location LIKE "%NY%"
GROUP BY location
HAVING COUNT(orderID)>= 3;

#10 How many of each type of headphone were sold in February?

SELECT COUNT(product), product
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
WHERE Product LIKE "%headphones"
GROUP BY product;

#11 What was the average amount spent per account in February?

SELECT avg(price*quantity) 
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.customers
ON FebSales.orderID= customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID';

#12 What was the average quantity of products purchased per account in February?

select sum(quantity)/count(customers.acctnum)
FROM BIT_DB0.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB0.customers 
ON FebSales.orderid=customers.order_id
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

#13 Which product brought in the most revenue in January and how much revenue did it bring in total?

SELECT SUM(price*quantity) Revenue, product
FROM BIT_DB0.JanSales
GROUP BY product
ORDER BY Revenue DESC
LIMIT 1;
